vs-android v0.94 - 24th July 2012
=================================

vs-android is intended to provide a collection of scripts and utilities to support integrated development of
Android NDK C/C++ software under Microsoft Visual Studio.

Currently vs-android only works under Visual Studio 2010. Earlier versions lack the MSBuild integration with 
the C/C++ compilation systems.


Required Support SDKs
=====================

Cygwin is not required at all to use vs-android, thankfully!

At a bare minimum the Android NDK needs to be installed. This will allow compilation of C/C++ code:
* http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html


In order to build an apk package to run on an Android device, you'll also require:

The Android SDK:
* http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

The Java JDK:
* http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Apache Ant:
* http://ant.apache.org/

Version History
===============

v0.94 - 24th July 2012

  * Completely reworked the deploy and run portions of vs-android.
  * Deploy has its own configuration pane: "Android Deployment", and saves these settings to the .user file.
  * The Deployment process in general is much more robust. "Build->Cancel" also now works correctly when deploying.
  * "Build->Deploy Solution/Deploy Project" now works on Android APK projects, to simply run the deploy step.
    Enable the "Deploy" checkbox for your project in the Solution "Configuration Manager" to enable this.
  * You can now run a deployed app by using "Debug->Run" (F5)! It's a bit of a hacky method, but appears to work fine.
  * NDK r8b was a breaking change for vs-android. This version now requires r8b or newer to be installed.
  * Fixed breaking changes to the location of libstdc++ STL libraries.
  * Fix for Google breaking change to x86 paths: "i686-android-linux" -> "i686-linux-android".
  * Added support for the new GCC 4.6 toolchains.
  * Added support for the new MIPS toolchains.
  * Tested and hopefully fixed issues such that vs-android works fully with a 64-bit JDK install.
  * Fix to make it possible to build projects in paths that contain spaces. Thanks to 'null77'.
  * Added 'Forced Include File' to "C/C++ -> Advanced" property sheet. Thanks to 'danfilner'.
  * Fix to make sure ARM5/ARM7 GCC flags are passed correctly to the compiler. Thanks to 'Drew Dunlop'.


v0.93 - 13th November 2011

  * NDK r7 was a breaking change for vs-android. This version now requires r7 or newer to be installed.
  * Fixed breaking changes to the location of STL libraries. Also fixed new linking issues introduced by STL changes.
  * Removed support for defunct arm 4.4.0 toolset.
  * Added support for android-14, Android API v4.0.
  * Added support for the dynamic (shared) version of the GNU libstdc++ STL.
  * Tested against newest JDK - jdk-7u1-windows-i586.
  * Added support for building assembly files. '.s' and '.asm' extensions will be treated as assembly code.
  * Correct passing of ANT_OPTS to the Ant Build step. Thanks to 'mark.bozeman'.
  * Corrected expected apk name for release builds.
  * Added to Ant Build property page; the ability to add extra flags to the calls to adb.
  * Fixed bug with arm arch preprocessor defines not making it onto the command line.
  * Fixed bad quote removal on paths, in the C# code. Thanks to 'hoesing@kleinbottling'.
  * Removed stlport project from Google Code - This was an oversight by Google in the r6 NDK, prebuilt is back again.
  * Updated sample projects to work with R15 SDK tools.


v0.92 - 3rd August 2011

  * Fixed jump-to-line clickable errors. Reworked code to use regular expressions instead. Tried a number 
    of different compiler/linker warnings and errors and all seems to be good
  * Default warning level is now 'Normal Warnings', instead of 'Disable All Warnings'. Whoops!
  * Fixed rtti-related warnings when compiling .c files with 'Enable All Warnings (-Wall)', turned on.


v0.91 - 2nd August 2011

  * Windows debugger is now usable. Fixed 'CLRSupport' error.
  * Error checking to ensure the 32-bit JDK is used.
  * Added JVM Heap options to Ant Build step. Initial and Maximum sizes are able to be set there now.
  * Added asafhel...@gmail's 'clickable errors from compiler' C# code.
  * Modified clickable errors code to also work with #include errors, which specify the column number too.
  * Added clickable error support to linker too.


v0.9 - 20th July 2011

  * Major update, hence the skip in numbers. Closing in on a v1.0 release.
  * Verified working with Android NDK r5b, r5c, and r6.
  * Much of vs-android functionality moved from MSBuild script to C# tasks. Similar approach now to Microsoft's
    existing Win32 setup.
  * Dependency checking rewritten to use tracking log files.
  * Dependency issues fixed, dependency checking also now far quicker.
  * Android Property sheets now completely replace the Microsoft ones, no more rafts of unused sheets.
  * Property sheets populated with many options. Switches are no longer hard-coded within vs-android script.
  * STL support added. Choice between 'None', 'Minimal', 'libstdc++', and 'stlport'.
  * Support for x86 compilation with r6 NDK.
  * Full support for v7-a arm architecture, as well as the existing v5.
  * Support for Android API directories other than just 'android-9'.
  * Separated support for 'dynamic libraries' and 'applications'. Applications build to apk files.
  * Response files used in build, no more command-line length limitations.
  * Deploy and run within Visual Studio, adb is now invoked by vs-android.
  * 'Echo command lines' feature fixed.
  * All support SDK/libs (NDK, SDK, Ant, JDK) are okay living in directories with spaces in them now.
  * All bugs logged within Google Code are addressed.


v0.21 - 10th Feb 2011

  * Fixed issues with the 'ant build' step.
  * Added a sensible error message if the NDK envvar isn't set, or is set incorrectly.


v0.2 - 1st Feb 2011

  * Changed default preprocessor symbols to work the same way Microsoft's stuff does. Should fix any 
    issues with intellisense as well.
  * Added support for scanning header dependencies


v0.1 - 30th Jan 2011

  * Initial version.
  * All major functionality present, barring header dependency checking.
